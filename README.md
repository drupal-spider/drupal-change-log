# Drupal Change Log Archive

This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of Drupal core change records. It provides detailed, aggregated information about the changes introduced in various Drupal versions, making it a valuable resource for developers, themers, and site builders.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to offer a centralized and easily accessible collection of change logs. This helps the Drupal community to:

-   Understand the impact of new releases on modules, themes, and sites.
-   Track deprecations, API changes, and new features.
-   Prepare for upgrades by reviewing all relevant changes in one place.

## Structure

The change records are organized by Drupal's major version. Each major version has its own directory.

For example:
-   `drupal-11/`: Contains all change records related to Drupal 11.

Within each version directory, you will find Markdown files corresponding to specific minor releases. For instance, `drupal_changes_all_details_11.2.0.md` contains all the published change records for Drupal core version 11.2.0.

## Content

Each file is a compilation of the official change records published on Drupal.org. The records include:

-   **Title and Link:** The title of the change record and a direct link to the node on drupal.org.
-   **Version Information:** The Drupal version in which the change was introduced.
-   **Impacts:** Who is affected by the change (e.g., module developers, site builders).
-   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the change, often including code snippets, before-and-after examples, and migration instructions.

## Source

All information is sourced directly from the official Drupal.org Change Records. This repository aims to mirror that information in a structured, file-based format for offline access and easier searching.
